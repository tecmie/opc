            <p>Lessons in the SPOC curriculum are currently majoring in the technical and soft skills aspects of learning. The
                learning experience is also more of a peer to peer learning experience where a teacher how knows how to code
                is not necessarily required for te club to run. The students practice soft skills such as leadership and
                group work. The technical skills will be discussed more in depth when we get to the specifics of what programming
                languages are learnt in SPOC.
