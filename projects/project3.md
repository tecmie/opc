# 19. SPOC Website

**Introduction:**

Building our very own club website. Seems exciting? In this lesson, we will be making a SPOC website. We will include tonnes of information and experiences we have had so far with the content.

Remember that you should achieve the design in the image above thereafter, you can style the website as you desire.

For this project, we will make use of the section tag to better divide a work and make it easier to read and got through, here is an example:

```
//Section A
<section>
  <div class="Fist">
    <p> Each hair on a human head grows one centimeter a month.<p>
  </div>
</section>

//Section B
<section>
  <div class="Second">
    <p>Many say good things come in pairs.</p>
  </div>
</section>

```


**Instructions:**

1. Click run to see the rendered page as it is.
2. Link the CSS file to the HTML file as always.
3. Create a div with the class name container in the html file.
4. Create sections for the following items:
    * Lessons
    * Student Board
    * High Schools
    * The code(HTML and CSS)
    * Projects(The ones you have done so far)
    * Activities
    * Moringa School
5. Still in the first section, use this image http://bit.ly/2HjcihW  at Next, we will divide our project into about 5 sections.
6. In the first section tag, create a div with the class name `banner`.
7. Within this banner div, create a span tag with  the words Secondary school Open-source Curriculum with the letters that spell out SPOC to be between strong tags. Your code should look like this:

```html
 <span>
    <strong>S</strong>econdary School
    <strong>P</strong>ractical
    <strong>O</strong>pen-source
    <strong>C</strong>urriculum
</span>

```
The heading of the website should read Secondary school Practical Open-source  Curriculum.

8. The next step is to add an image of the SPOCK hand symbol beneath the span tag. The url the image is : http://bit.ly/2HjcihW  align it to the top center of the page.Give the image the alt attribute with a value of spoc and a class `name` of `spoc` as well and this marks the end of our banner div.
9. Create another div after the one with the class name banner, and give it a class name lessons. It should still remain within the first section.

    *  Here, add a h3 tag with the heading Lessons
    * Next, we will add an image of a clipboard to our lessons div. The url  is : http://bit.ly/2FdeqXO. Give it an alternative name of lessons and a class name called  lessons.
    * Next add a paragraph with an explanation on what the lessons you have gone through in the SPOC program are and what you've learnt from them so far.  Make this at least 60 words long.

This marks the end of the div and the first section.

10. Next, we will create our second section and add a div with the class name student-board.
    * Add a h3 tag with the heading Student Board
    * Add an image: http://bit.ly/2Fg2DIs with the alt attribute as student board
    * Create a paragraph with a brief explanation of how the student board works in your school and the great qualities in the members in it.

	This marks the end of the div and second section.
11. The third section: create a new section with a div with the class name schools
    * Add a h3 tag with the heading School.
    * Add an image: http://bit.ly/1WsYJka with the alt attribute as school.
    * Create a paragraph explaining how the program has impacted your school life.
12. For the four the fourth section,  create  a div with the class name code.
    * Add a h3 tag with the heading The Code.
    * Add the following image below your h3 tag : http://bit.ly/2Fe6JAF with alt and class as code-icon.
    * Create a paragraph talking about the two languages you have learnt so far, that is HTML and CSS.

13. The next section is for your  projects.
