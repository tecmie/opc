# Fifth Project -Pan-African Games

## 20.1 Pan-African Games -Part I

**Introduction:**

Hello SPOC kids!

Today's project will be based on learning a lot our African heritage. The steps to learn this will be in the form of taking a trip across Africa to learn about different types of games played in these countries. 

We will write code that will explain how these games work and gather some pictures on how they look and are played.
So let's dive right into it.

What we will require for this trip across Africa is:

1. A list of the games
2. A short description of each game
3. At least one image of each board game
4. And finally clear and easy-to-understand instructions     on how to play these games.

Some of the countries we will be looking at are: Kenya, Ghana, Mozambique, South Africa, Egypt among many more.

Take keen note of the areas of HTML and CSS we will also focus most of our energy on:
The navigation bar
Tables
Ordered Lists
Images
Links
And any additional items you would like to add to beef up your websites!

**Instructions:**

1. Click run to see the rendered page as it is.
2. Add Pan-African Games between the title tags.
3. Create your first div and give it a class name `container`.
4. From here, we will build the navigation bar consisting of the following links:
    * Countries
    * Games
    * More info

5. Remember to link your CSS file to the HTML.
6. The nav bar skeleton has already been done for you. Input the links mentioned above.
7. From there, style the navbar appropriately just like we practiced in the previous projects.
8. Once you are done, you will notice three more divs below the navigation section, here you will be required to fill in the following:
    * Country div: add an image of the country mentioned and style it appropriately using the following properties: box-shadow, height and width, float left and any more css properties you would want to use .  
    Also, some information about the country and what is is most famous for, get creative as you can. Note: use the p tags
    * Next is the Game div: here you will see the title of about three games found in a specified country. In this case the games here are found in Kenya. What you will be required to do is find a brief suitable description and image for the game. The first one is done for you. Do the same for the other two.
    * Lastly, we have the instructions section. Here, you will gather five-seven instructions on how any of the three games is played. Make use of the ordered list and get creative on styling these instructions.

9. Click run to see the rendered page.
10. Run tests then submit when all pass.

## 20.2 Pan-African Games -Part II

**Introduction:**

In this day's work our focus will be on designing a similar website to the the games we found in Kenya previously. This is a journey we are on. Travelling the continent in search of amazing games played across different countries. Today we visit West Africa to a country called Ghana.
Build and design a website based on the in the brief instructions and information provided below. Remember that most of the concepts we applied in lesson 20.1 are a lot similar so try and be as unique as possible.

**Introduction:**

1. Click run to see the rendered page as it is.
2. Create the first div and give it a class name of container.

## 20.2 Pan-African Games - Part III

In this third phase of our project, we will be building a website for board games from Mozambique. In this phase, we will get a little more creative with designing this website. We will not only give a background check of Mozambique but also style this section //Will come back to this intro

**Instructions:**

1. Click run to see the rendered page as it is.
